Figure 3 - Graphs showing velocities over time for two force boundary models. a) Demonstrates a stress of 220 MPa from 0 to 7 Myr and then a linear decrease in stress to 50 MPa from 7 Myr to 9 Myr. This model ends in low velocities so breakup stops occuring. b) Demonstrates a stress of 220 MPa from 0 to 7 Myr and then a linear decrease in stress to 75 MPa from 7 Myr to 9 Myr. This model results in rapidly increasing velocities causing solver convergence errors by 8.2 Myr.
